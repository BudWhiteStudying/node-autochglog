# Node Auto-Changelog

> `node-autochglog` is a CLI tool that generates a changelog based on commit messages, assuming that they're written using the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) syntax. It is meant to be used in CI/CD pipelines, or in pre-commit hooks.

## Data model

Here are some concepts to better understand the logic behind the tool:

- to the purpose of this tool, a `Changelog` is a list of `Release` items;
- each `Release` item contains a list of `Category` items;
- each `Category` item contains a list of `Commit items`.

In other words, a _changelog_ is a list of _releases_, each _release_ contains a number of _commits_, that are arranged in _categories_ within the _release_ they belong to.

_Releases_ are defined by git tags, _categories_ are defined by Conventional Commit prefixes of _commit_ messages.

## Installation

For making it available within a project:

```bash
npm install save-dev node-autochglog
```

For making it available globally:

```bash
npm install -g node-autochglog
```

## Usage

Currently, `node-autochglog` is in its earliest version and doesn't really accept any configuration. As a consequence, it is also very easy to use.

Just run the following command in the root of the project you want to generate a changelog for:

```bash
node-autochglog
```

...that's it.

## Configuration

The tool accepts configuration from a `node-autochglog.config.json`, expected to be found in the directory where the `node-autochglog` command is executed; the file is expected to contain a single JSON object adhering to the [NodeAutoChglogConfig](./src/config/NodeAutochglogConfig.ts) interface:

```typescript
export interface NodeAutoChglogConfig {
  tagFilter: string;
  initialTag: string;
  templateLocation: string;
  targetBranch: string;
  outputFilepath: string;
  allowedCategories: { key: string; label?: string }[];
}
```

    <th>Purpose</th>
    <th>Default</th>

    <td><code>tagFilter</code></td>
    <td>RegEx used for determining which tags are considered as versions; tags not matching the RegEx will be ignored</td>

    <td><code>templateLocation</code></td>
    <td>Path to the <a href='https://mustache.github.io/'>Mustache</a> template to be used for the changelog; <b>whatever custom template you provide, it will have to work with the metadata provided by the tool, represented by the <a href='./src/model/Changelog.ts'><code>Changelog</code></a> interface</b></td>

    <td>List of key/label objects defining which commit prefixes (<code>key</code>) shall be considered as valid categories and which labels (<code>label</code>) shall be used in order to represent them; the <code>label</code> property is optional, if absent the <code>key</code> property will be used in its place.</td>
